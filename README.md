# <p align="center">Angel's Archives</p>

Welcome to my archives, a graveyard of various over-ambitious projects. Please do not bother contributing anything here, none of these projects are getting updated.

### <p align="center">List of archived projects</p>
Coming soonâ„¢ *(...maybe)*

### <p align="center">Archived websites</p>
A proper list of my archived websites are hosted under a separate [sites branch](https://github.com/AngelDTF/archives/tree/sites). They can be viewed by heading over to my main website (https://angeldtf.github.io/) and appending `/archives/<name>` to the URL path (replace `<name>` with the name of the specific site you're trying to visit).
